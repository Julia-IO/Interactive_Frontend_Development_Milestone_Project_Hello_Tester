-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Hello Tester red, and yellow, as a representation of the Spanish flag, as we offer Spanish-speaking localisation services.
    -   #### Typography
        -   Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a friendly font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   We've created avatars of the testers to create a sense of closeness.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Image with Text and a "Contact us" button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the h1 header slogan: 'Spanish-speaking Localisation QA Testers - Boost accuracy and speed.'
        3. The user can scroll down to discover testimonials or learn more about what our testers can do for them.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
    

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to see a clear 'About' located at the footer of all pages.
        1. If the user navigate the menu, I want the user to be able to have more info on the testers to know what are we exactly offering.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer. Please, note that because this project does not exist in reality, those are the only links which are not working.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
    

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the the different plans and pricings available and see if there are any offers.
        1. On top of the page, they can access to our plans, and also they can arrive there through the traditional menu navigation.
        2. If the user wants to try our services for free, we want to make sure they can contact us easily through the Contact Form and also via Calendly widget which is always present in the down right corner.

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   Depending on screen size, when the Filtered Selection Containers under 'Equipment and Skills' of testers pages are forced to occupy 2 lines, they might not be correctly aligned on the second line.
   
-   On small screen (mobile devices), Calendly snippet is covering partially some of the text, which can be annoying.
